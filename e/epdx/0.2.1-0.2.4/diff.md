+# EPDx
+
+EPDx is a library for parsing EPD files into a common exchange format.
+
+The library is written in Rust, to allow for cross-language package distribution.
+Currently, we support Javascript/Typescript, Python and Rust.
+
+EPDx is part of a larger project of making life cycle assessments more accessible and transparent to building
+professionals.
+
+Read more about our [overall goal](https://github.com/ocni-dtu/life-cycle-formats)
+
+## ILCD+EPD
+
+The ILCD+EPD format is a digital format for EPDs.
+Provided in either XML or JSON.
+
+Initially EPDs were provided as PDFs.
+That is not very convenient for automation processes and requires large amounts of manual work to process.
+
+The ILCD (International Life Cycle Data System) is a data format developed by the European Commission to give LCA
+practitioners a common digital format for life cycle assessments.
+In order to integrate EPD specific information (e.g. scenarios, modules, type of data), extensions were added to the
+ILCD format. The resulting format got named ILCD+EPD format.
+
+The ECO Platform and Ökobau uses the format to store and expose EPDs through
+the [soda4LCA](https://bitbucket.org/okusche/soda4lca/src/7.x-branch/) API.
+The API makes it possible for everyone to search and download tons of EPDs to be used free of charge.
+
+The ILCD+EPD format is a node based format. It means that each EPD consists of several layers of nodes that contain
+different information.
+The first node contains a summary of the EPD, with references to the nodes.
+By drilling down the tree of nodes, you have access to more and more specific information, such as EPD manufacturer,
+functional unit(s), etc.
+
+Read more about ILCD at the [European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/)

-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
